# Contributing to the Newport Data Project

This guide is here to help you contribute to the Newport Data Project. There are lots of ways to help, and many don't require any technical expertise.

### Quick Things

If you're looking for a way to help in a free moment, here are some ideas:

* Contribute Newport data to OpenStreetMap - OSM is a source of data that we use for our projects, and making it better helps the Project and the open source community at-large.
* Find open datasets online - There is already a lot of data out there, and we can always use help discovering new sources.



### General Meetings

We have general team meetings on the 3rd Saturday of each month. We cover highlights of what we're working on and plans for future projects and events. Check the slack workspace for details and agendas.



### Join a Team

There are working groups and project teams working on different parts of the Project.
